# NOD

## Introduction

NOD is a plain-text file format, a blend of YAML and Markdown. But it's also an ecosystem of apps designed to use, manage, and build upon these files.

Instead of organizing your files and data in a hierarchical manner, NOD files (*.nod) serve as interlinked nodes in a graph-based organization.

Files and folders were originally designed to mimic a real desktop in a corporate environment, a concept used to sell personal computers. However, more and more developers and designers tend to build tools and applications with a graph-based organization that is more aligned with how our brains work. NOD is a small step toward this goal.

## Example

Here's an example of a nod file:

## Roadmap

Applications that utilize nod files include:

- MAP (Mind Access Protocol): Manage and explore your nod files
- IDM (Image Display Manager): Display images and create slideshows
- DOT (Do One Thing): Task management
- LOG (Life Output Graphics): A tracking system

## For Developers

NOD is not just a set of applications; it's also a library that developers can leverage to build their own tools. By creating a tool that utilizes the NOD file format, you're contributing to an ever-expanding ecosystem. This makes it easier for everyone to organize their data in a way that's more natural and intuitive.

We encourage developers to get involved, contribute, and help grow the NOD ecosystem. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or creating entirely new applications, your contributions are welcome.
